***Hypothesis:***
Financial literacy is directly related to wealth. Despite an abundance of free resources, the lower and middle classes remain financially illiterate. We hypothesize that many people are financially illliterate not solely due to a lack of resources, but rather, **due to a lack of time, interest, resources, and environment.**
 ***Mission Statement:***

For financially inexperienced and overwhelmed college students who tend to overspend and are dissatisfied with budgeting apps like Mint and NerdWallet, our idea is a personal finance copilot.

**True Self and False Self**: The "true self" is the spontaneous, authentic self, while the "false self" is a defensive facade that arises when the true self feels threatened by an environment that is not supportive or responsive to the child's needs. The false self protects the true self but can become predominant if the individual's environment is consistently unresponsive or intrusive.

Take advantage of so many people wanting to do startups with you. Do it with all of them and de-risk yourself. MVP development. Run through and fail quick. Why work on one startup at once when you can work on multiple at the same time. 

You need to enjoy and admire the ppl working with you. Regardless of the situation. Stop judging them and see them for what they are. Admire them and learn from them and their experiences

Working on a financial copilot that integrates macroeconomics, data analytics, and personal finance to help people manage their finances cheaper, faster, and better 

—> cannot do this alone fast enough, need to create a developer market 

Open source personal finance applications —> what is a business model for that?

accounting for startups 

AI and computer program to hold you accountable 

Technical analysis —> everything is included in price. Based off cyclical behavior. Price Patterns are important. 

It’s all about having a stong process. 

Price Action

High Level Process Flow
Prices (open, high, low, close, volume)
Workplace (price patterns & indicators)
	absolute price
	relative price (absolute divided by benchmark)
Screen & Select: Input= rules, output = tickers
Trade& Risk Plan Input= rules, output = price (I think)
Analyze (I think)

Looking at charts & patterns = art and the science is the indicators and math 

candlestick —> Open, high, low, & close prices. Popular types of candlestick patterns

Technical patterns: support & resistance levels (momentum or reversal). Support is like a floor
Bullsish breakout
Head & shoulders for bullish breakouts
Flag patterns, (cup & hold??)

Trend (sciences)
Moving averages
RSI 14. Above 50 bullish, below 50 bearish

Application, Tying it all together:
Strategy (indicator, time period), Art vs Science (calculate opportunities), Screening (collect opportunities and find trades based on arts and science), Risk (invest, position sizing, trade journal), Trade (based off plan & strategy), Trade Analysis (logging)

(My own thoughts —> is there a platform that facilitates all of this?) Building the actual shovels —> is that Bloomberg basically? —> looks like it is —> what about the logging (seems dumb, but maybe there’s opportunity))
