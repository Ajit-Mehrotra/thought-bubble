Stressed u notice more things about ppl — u become more critical. At least I do. What did u notice about me?

Also, people always change when they’re stressed. Their demeanor, what they say, how they say it. How did my personality change during times of stress. Did I become more arrogant, intolerant, refuse to listen, increasingly rude and insensitive? 

For Instagram, maybe we should have streetwear fashion tips as posts or stories or something. Fun facts and shit too. 

Should we get canva pro or no

If we start thinking about the small things like SASA and what Afoo thinks of us and stuff it will get in the way of what actually matters. In reality all of this is extremely small.

Like people are out here going to the moon, planning how to completely transform the travel industry and change our lives on the daily and we’re out here thinking about what one person and organization thinks about us? Nah. It’s impossible to think about the small things of you want to be big. Like look at the fucking noon. Someone went there 50 years ago. Look at Mars. You can’t even see that shit. Ppl are planning how to live there rn. Yet we’re out here thinking about papers and organizations. Nah we’re better than that. We need to get past it quick.

Native similarities between Shintoism and Hinduism and relational similarities - similarities due to Buddhism as a middle man
