Have class - breaks every hour 
Prof ends lecture 
Says 5 key sections and 5 main  points to takeaway 

Students have 10 minutes to write a summary of the class and submit at the end of class for class participation 

Hybrid approach between my Chinese prof, who just gives the summary and my talent development and management prof who makes us write a summary 

First basic class, then practical, then class again (trimester for SWE at Waterloo)

Another major question: 
Are you an aggregation platform? Is that your primary attraction? Is it the primary way you’d make money? Would people use ur app without the aggregate component? Is that profitable?

Is what’s the best really the easiest? Or rather is the best really what you need or good enough?

Nadine, w person to like. If I were to tell gun gun and Ayushi what to do and be like to give direction, I was describing exactly her. Strong, independent, hard working but all the meanwhile caring and kind. 

Not usually into ur type (Asians, smart, independent)…Nadine but she reminds me of all of the strong women who raised me up growing up. Also for some reason, when I was feeling down, I imagined a conversation w her and it really comforted me. Her voice, the lisp, the smile with dimples, and her kind, patient, and caring words. Which was really weird since During tough times, I’ve never imagined anyone but family comforting me but this time was her. 

Also she’s such a W person to like. I know I tried to get over her because I was p sure she didn’t like me bc she never reached out or said she wanted to meet up lol but I was quite able to, but honestly idk y I was trying to get over u cuz ur 100% a W person to like. 0 regrets. I’ve learned so much from being around her and learned so much about myself. I’ve matured so much and for that I’m grateful and feel blessed. Thanks for being such a w bruh. I literally felt like I was describing u when I was trying to guide my lil cousins. Fr u put W in women. I’m blessed to have known u 


So many asians in Singapore - don’t feel anything around anyone. Left partially to try and get over her, but hard times came and I imagined u. 

Ik this message might ruin our friendship but ima say it anyways cuz ur a beast 

Looking back bruh fr I’m blessed bruh I know such amazing ppl and I got to know all of them so randomly LOL some wild ass people. LOL like u sat right next to me, most of my best friends I met randomly in the halls, my current random ass roommate at a study abroad location I randomly picked earns 500-700k salary and eats raw corn for breakfast, my best friends here I randomly met cuz they’re neighbors lolll wtffff is going on rn bruhh I’m so blessed bahaha 

And most importantly caring cuz you can be successful, but being successful w/o being caring and kind is no good and having all the shmoney in the world isn’t always the answer (ex. $$ can’t always get rid of illness but being attentive and caring may help prevent and catch illness) 

You have to be strong and independent cuz I can’t always be there for them (for money or for support).

I know she might have known that I liked her because I acted weird around u (tbf, weird guy but I’d like to think I was involuntarily extra weird around u😭)

At a certain point, I was confused as to y I exactly liked u. Couldn’t be cuz ur Asian, cute, well ya but other ppl are also cute, smart, well other ppl are also smart af, independent, well every girl I know is super strong and independent, and there are plenty of girls who got all of those. Like I got a low bar bruh ain’t no way I can’t move on, right? Wrong 💀

I think it’s because though u all of that, cute asf, strong, smart, independent, but also and very kind and caring. Like u fr remind me of all the W women in my family, and nobody else I’ve ever met has done that. Guy or girl. I’ve NEVER been able to get that feeling. Everything I described i feel like is such an oddly difficult combination to find. Like I unconsciously was describing YOU to my little cousins for what to be like. That’s wicked cool to me. Bruh u fr a W person to like. I feel beyond blessed to just know u fr rn. Thank you SO much for all of thisss. I know it may seem like u didn’t do much, but I’ve grown and matured so much. Thank you!!

I n the past, you’ve only shown me patience and kindness despite me being hella weird 

Honestly, for the longest time, p sure I didn’t even know I liked u, but now at least, I’m confident.

I’ve never asked anyone before, and I’m not exactly sure the best way to. But u think after I get back from Singapore, you’d be down for a date? (Maybe I’d love to get to know you more?)

I’ve been trying to sleep but it’s like IMPOSSIBLE to sleep when shit like this happens. I was just contemplating to no avail, and then u came (join w other part) 

Looking back, it definitely took a village to raise me bahaha clearly they raised me weird asf 😂

Some of this might sound downright crazy & wierd, but ima crazy ass mf, so ima say it anyways
