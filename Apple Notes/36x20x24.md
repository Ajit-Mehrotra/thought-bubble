- Split this first part into 4 fundamental processes 
- Before deep dive, Assumptions:
	- When customer selects delivery, if they enter address > 5mi, notify that we won’t deliver 
	- Singular order deliveries. Not for multiple deliveries in one run.
	- Numbered shelves so dogs know where to go
	- 2 robots are paired with a truck. Only 1 robot works on an order at a time. The other is charging. Every order they switch. Reduces number of times both dogs are simultaneously out of charge

	Part 2:
	- Overview of the next part:
		- During the delivery, the robot and truck might run into two issues. Technical problems or customer address problems 
		- Delivery 
	- Assumptions:
	- MSBC has a 3rd party vendor or warranty that is for repair and emergencies just like AAA but for autonomous vehicles and robots 
		- Tech problems are too rare to cost effectively fix 
	- When customer inputs the correct location, it’s assumed to be <5 mi from store

Notes
Problem: United States citizens and constituents aren’t able to communicate their desires and problems effectively with United States representatives

There is no widespread social media app dedicated to serious politics for learning and for communicating between constituents 

The main goal, purpose, and vibe of the app would be different than existing forms of media: it’s meant to inform, educate, drive meaningful impact in your community with the click of a button. Compared to twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, it’s different 

The goal is to connect the representatives to the app as well. They can hold polls and ask for opinions and such — would be interesting to hear where problems could form 

Bring power back to the people 

Modernizing democracy 

Should be pretty bipartisan 

App name ideas: unshackle, unshackled, red white blue, respite, reblite, blit 

Ask John and Robert overthrust 

The representatives could send notifications to constituents via the app. Would make it so much easier for everyone. I wonder what the technology situation looks like there 

Could potentially start at the county level — reach out to HOCO


I think we’re going to be hitting  an art rennisance again — a rennisance specifically about self expression with the increase in popularity of Streetwear and graffiti.it’s just rhe beginning .
Maybe I could create a platform/app for self expression. Somehow need to create a platform that inspires others … even w music and shit 

Defconcyber security shit


Fingerprint/limited access for guns — must be easy to modify existing in’s

Current market/development approach for creating games is incorrect. It follows what game developers want, not what the public/industry/market potential has in store. For example, need to come up w games for women, for Fortnite, among us
