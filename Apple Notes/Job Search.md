Questions for recruiters regarding organization’s DEI

Here are thoughtful questions that students can ask recruiters during interviews or other interactions to assess their organizations’ DEI priority and commitment:
- **How does your organization define diversity? What lenses of diversity has your organization made a direct commitment toward?**
- **Does your organization have a chief diversity officer (CDO) or a designated leader to drive DEI and engage internal and external stakeholders?**
- **What social causes does your organization support?**
- **Does your organization actively support diverse suppliers, contractors, and small businesses?**
- **Has your organization made any formal commitments in support of racial equity?**
- **How does your organization center diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging?**
- **Does your organization offer any formal employee training around biases, anti-racism, or general DEI?**
- **How has your organization prioritized executive accountability toward DEI advancement?**
- **Does your organization have any affinity groups or committees to support diverse populations? If so, how do these groups contribute to the culture of the organization?**
- **Does your organization complete annual compensation equity analysis?**
- **What resources has your organization provided to its employees in support of COVID-19 and racial injustices?**
