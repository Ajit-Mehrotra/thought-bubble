- Project idea: book to notes. Taking notes for books but digitally. Like find some middle ground. I like writing hand written notes but also like to have it digitalized. Also, I don’t want to manually write processes in my notes. Instead, I want to link my written notes and my digital notes that could scan the notes and link it. Like in my written notes I could write “see x-process” and then scan the process in the book using my phone (mix in some AI) and link x-process to the written notes” and boom!

- Many ppl who can’t find a community on campus, join a fraternity. To do so, most have to change themselves to fit in through the “process” and the fraternity’s “culture”. They changed themselves to fit into an existing community as they couldn’t find a community that was true to their original character. I think, those who don’t naturally fit into the fraternity and are willing to change themselves to fit in (most people), are weak as they are (unconsciously or consciously) willing to give up and change who they are and their values in order to fit in. A mature person would never give up their identity so easily  
- I couldn’t find a community that allowed me stay true to myself. So I created my own community where I could feel welcomed and could help others like me feel so as well. I think my experience being lonely (and for so long) helped me lead effectively by providing a greater sense of empathy and an ability to think against the grain.

- Smart people awesome, not because they’re smart, but because they make life easier for people like me. In that sense, they’re my heros! 
- Sometimes I forget the skills and moments I was gifted by looking at other peoples accomplishments. I’m so thankful for everything I’ve been given. I’m beyond blessed. 
- Burdened with glorious purpose (green, black, and gold)
- If surrounding myself with smart and hard working individuals makes me feel anxious, stressed, and uncomfortable what does that say about me? Meanwhile, being around regular/unique/untraditional people makes me feel so comfortable, happy, and relaxed. 
- They say you should be around the people you want to be like. But a lot of ambitious and  successful people (regardless of success level) are successful and ambitious, yes, but nobody talks about their other half, that the vast majority are also extremely anxious, stressed, insecure, egotistical (when u know they have one and they try and not to be but come off as unauthentic, and sometimes can be off-putting), unauthentic and sometimes even mean. Most of them are driven by status and money, and I feel like it’s a mob mentality of sorts, and they’re so deep into it, it’s tough for them to take a step back and realize it. now I’m not saying that you shouldn’t hang around smart and ambitious people, but many of them, even the best, in my experience have made me feel stressed and have unintentionally pressured me into pressuring myself into not being myself. Whether that be because their anxiety, insecurity, and inauthenticity is contagious along with their curiosity, I don’t know. Being stressed and anxious isn’t necessarily The issue is that by constantly being around them, I’m in a constant state of anxiousness and stress. It won’t go away like it usually does, and stress, anxiety for me at least, is certainly contagious and causes people to panic, which is why as a leader, I try not to act stressed or anxious around my team. Be as cool as a pickle and don’t put stress on others or myself. Just quietly get the work done and celebrate the small wins until we get the victory royale. I’d love to hang around truly an authentic, and stress-free smart person, but they’re rarer than I think since I’ve only come across two (Angel and Chad). I’m glad I have the friends I do, and I’m glad they are the way they are :) and I hope my success never makes anyone else feel like they’re not good enough. The tough part is somehow doing that. I’m unsure how to, because that is also dependent on them and their past. I have to still try my best tho :)
- I can’t believe it took me so long to understand it. I couldn’t explain the feeling of why I felt so stressed around smart people. Im sure im partially insecure, but again, im insecure around my friends and they manage to get rid of my insecurities instead of feeding them. For some reason, with smart people, even when they praise you, it feels fake and like they don’t mean it. It’s wild. It’s like they just don’t have the right vibe, even when they try. It feels like they’re programmed to say it to make themselves feel better by trying to make me feel better. When im with happy and smart people or with just regular friends, I never feel insecure. All of us feel so satisfied. We don’t complain, we aren’t sad or stressed, but there’s just smiles, laughter, and optimism all around. We feel so free and we don’t force anyone to do anything or even pressure. We recognize when others are insecure and we push them out of their insecurities (like Rohit and Rohan did for me). Even in tough times, all of us smile and laugh. We smile and laugh through stress and anxiety and let it pass and try our hardest to never let it get the better of us. Being around friends and family like that is really a state of bliss. I’m so blessed.

- “Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.”
- I don’t like judging others because I hate it when others judge me. The feeling of feeling invalid, and the craze, the addiction, and stress behind feeling the need to prove my worth to myself through validation in the eyes of those around me. I hope I never make anyone feel that way. 
- Ego is only bad when it judges others. You judge others and see them as less. Makes you feel better, accomplished, validated, and even make your accomplishments feel sweeter. Knowing that not many others could not do it. It flips around when others are better than you. You judge them, see their accomplishments, and deep inside, you believe and hope you’re better and try to accomplish the same thing if not more to prove so to yourself and others. It’s toxic satisfaction. It feels nice, but it eats away at the mind and body. Many people recognize toxic ego, but are still blinded and led by it. Once they reach that level of success, what’s the next? People know they should be better, and there’s an ego and status associated with being successful yet humble/not egotistical. So, many people make an effort to hide their egos. They’re inauthentic, because their desire to be perceived as humble is rooted within ego and how they’re perceived by others. You can try and hide it, but you can tell, often by what they say and refuse/hesitate to say/they way they say it, provide help, talk behind peoples backs, etc, that they still judge others and see other people as less than them and others who are more as a target or a goal to beat. For me, it’s easy to tell who tries to hide it. Instead you can spot their inauthenticity and insecurities. What worked for me, the only way to move past ego is to stop judging others yourself. Ego is not bad, but when you use judging others as fuel for your ego, it becomes toxic. Since ego is will always be apart of you, like every other portion of your body and personality. If one part of yourself is toxic, it spreads to personality, thoughts, and even makes itself present physically through stress and anxiety, overall making you a negative person and someone people, including yourself loathe to be around. Another way to stop being toxically egotistical is to stop being around people who seek validation through success, money, and fame. You can be successful, have an ego, and not judge others (and yourself). Many people get stuck in that middle process where they try to prove to others that they are not egotistical anymore. Ego is just a small part of everyone. Life is much free-er without judging others. Much happier, healthier. It’s easier to be genuinely & actively grateful for what you have, be more in the moment, not worrying about the past or the future, and in general, you have much, much deeper and meaningful relationships with others when you don’t judge them and just enjoy who they are. It’s a state of blissful-ness that’s something I hope everyone can feel. Judging others, judging yourself is something that naturally happens, but often times, people make a habit of it.I hate that growing up, there was such a big focus on judging others and myself for everything. I feel like the way I grew up and the students and learning environment I was around programmed people to be toxic/egotistical. It’s something that can be unlearned if u just change the people you’re around.  
- If you think I don’t judge people, you’re wrong. I judged a lot of people in order to write this, and this was a super toxic writing this and I feel super uncomfortable as I’m writing it. Because I feel like I wrote this article out of hate. I hate that growing up my friends and fellow students, teachers, and adults judged me for how dumb, unprepared I was, for how I smelled, what I ate, etc. I hate the feeling of being judged. It’s the perfect equation for creating a bucket list of insecurities from a young age. Til this day, I feel ridiculously uncomfortable when people judge me. But, it makes the moments when friends and people go out of their way to genuinely make you comfortable by removing your insecurities of being judged entirely that much better, and im incredibly grateful for the friends that helped me overcome my insecurities by not judging me, my culture, and who I am by letting me live my life, the way I want to, and with freedom and support without fear of being judged 
- I’ve been doing a pretty good job of not judging others recently and I think it’s  because I have very supportive friends (many of them are guys, most in fact, so if u think guys aren’t supportive, you’re dead wrong). Beyond blessed to have them 
- Changed the people I surrounded myself from people who seemed validation from others via success, status, and money to authentic people I can be around (Indian/SASA, business frats to BSGO)
- How to achieve diversity. Create an environment where everyone has freedom to be yourself and not be judged for it. But those words are generic. What ACTIONS can you take to create a diverse workplace and a culture where people don’t judge and insecurities are overcome: celebrate all people cultures, 
- It’s when people aren’t insecure about themselves. That’s when they achieve freedom to be themselves and are comfortable enough 
- Doesn’t mean that you can’t bring up concerns: dude is smelly, and that bothers /disturbs other people. The culture will be a place where people are COMFORTABLE enough to actually say it to the person and the person is COMFORTABLE and not insecure enough to admit fault around a group of people, knowing that people won’t judge him for it!

- App that democratizes video training. Universities can use this as a supplement to actual learning. Problem is that most universities  aren’t actually up-to-date with their courseload/professors are bad/it’s not organized properly. However, a couple students create resources and pass it down from generation to generation. Universities can take advantage of this. By creating an app that allows students to create courses (YouTube + documentation + uploads) and then other students can add/remove/update based on a democratized system. So, for example, if I have a YouTube video for a certain concept, and a student finds a better YouTube video, they can upload it and it will come up as an alternative. Other students can actually upvote it, and if there are enough upvotes, it will actually replace it. Version tracking/control will be present. Also, students vote to add it as a supplement, instead of replacing it. Furthermore, students can update the documentation. In this sense, it’s a running documentation that passes from generation to generation and gives university students a competitive advantage without relying on professors

- Best way to get a founder is for people to reach out to you. Not the other way around. That’s the only way to get a passionate team. In order for the team dynamics, they have to believe in what you’re building and feel like they have a part in it. It’s tough to get that if you join a friend’s startup just because you believe in him.

Why do you call something that knows everything? A god, right? That’s what general intelligence AI is going to be. The other kinds of AI will be like humans. Some will be good, others will be bad. In general, you should probably consider and treat them as human. They’re made by humans to replicate human behavior and thought. They’ll soon reach that point within our lifetime. 

- you shouldn’t judge people. When you judge someone often time you judge their life, personality, and habits based on your past (childhood, parents, environment) but you don’t actually know what they’ve been through
