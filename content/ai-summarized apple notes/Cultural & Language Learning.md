## Reflections on Company Culture

### Observations
- Language barriers can cause feelings of exclusion among employees who don’t share a common language or culture.
- People tend to group by shared values, language, or culture, leading to less organic interaction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Offer language courses (e.g., Chinese) to promote cross-departmental interaction and inclusivity.
- Use engaging, culturally diverse media in company videos (e.g., hip hop/rap rather than generic piano tracks).
- Encourage employees to merge personal philosophies with their professional roles to enhance their sense of identity at work.
