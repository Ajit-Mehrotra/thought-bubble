## Capstone Project & Potential Startup

### Hypothesis
Financial literacy is linked to wealth. Many individuals remain financially illiterate due to a lack of time, interest, resources, or conducive environments.

### Mission
Empower the lower/middle class to improve their financial situations despite low literacy rates.

### Concept
Develop a personal finance copilot targeting college students, offering features beyond existing apps like Mint or NerdWallet:
- Predictive forecasting
- Economic context for decisions
- Budget automation

### Strategic Thoughts
- Collaborate with professors and mentors like [Prof. Raftopolous](mailto:raftopolous@institution.edu) and [Liz Brown](mailto:brown@institution.edu).
- Build a developer market for quick MVP iterations and multiple startup explorations simultaneously.
- Integrate features like:
  - Bill splitting
  - Deals and credit card savings
  - Open-source approaches

### Potential Application Areas
- Macroeconomics, technical analysis, and ETFs vs. mutual funds.
- AI-driven financial accountability programs.

### Broader Inspiration
- Leveraging tokenized securities and modern AI for personal finance.
- Exploring user-friendly financial tools like Bloomberg for broader accessibility.
